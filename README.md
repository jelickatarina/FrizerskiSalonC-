# Application Development using C# ASP.NET Core MVC with Entity Framework

This project demonstrates the development of a web application using **C# ASP.NET Core MVC** and **Entity Framework** for database integration. The application utilizes the **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** pattern for building a structured and maintainable web application, while **Entity Framework** provides an Object-Relational Mapper (ORM) for easy database access and manipulation.

## Features:
- **ASP.NET Core MVC**: A modern web development framework that allows building dynamic, data-driven websites.
- **Entity Framework**: ORM for easy data manipulation and querying.
- **CRUD Operations**: Ability to perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations on the database.
- **Database Integration**: Connects the application to a relational database (e.g., SQL Server) using Entity Framework.

## Technologies Used:
- **Backend**: C#, ASP.NET Core MVC
- **ORM**: Entity Framework Core
- **Database**: Microsoft SQL Server
